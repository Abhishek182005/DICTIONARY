It is my 1st Django project based on dictionary. Django Framework is the popular framework to build websites. This project<br>
need to import Pydictionary, a python module. <br>
The synonym and antonym are not available due to some complication of code of Pydictionary which doesnt mathces the target website<br>
from where it extracts the meaning. However it is able to give meaning. <br>
